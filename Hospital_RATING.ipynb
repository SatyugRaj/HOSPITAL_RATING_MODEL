    "**Evanston Hospital** is a acute healtcare facility in US, offering a wide range of services and surgerical specialities. Despite spending a considerable amount of resource on improvement of its services, the hospital's CMS rating has not changed for past 5 yrs, leading to a decline in revenue for the Hospital. The CMS ratings directly influence the choice made by consumers who are looking for a healthcare provider and hence eventually will impact the revenue of the HOSPITAL.\n",
    "**In this project we will identify the possible root causes (Root-cause Analysis) for the hospitals getting such avg ratings and also recomment some measures to sovle this problem**"
